    "As stated in [problem understanding](01_problem-understanding.ipynb) the training data is scraped from [POLITIFACT.com](https://www.politifact.com/). [POLITIFACT.com](https://www.politifact.com/) is a project run by non-profit organization Poynter Institue for Media Studies. [7] Via its website POLITIFACT, it verifies the truth of political statements in the USA. It originated as an election-year project of the Tampa Bay Times. [7] Since then it rates political statements into different truth categories. The statements originate from politicans, members of the US congress, White House and lobbyists. [7] Every statement is reviewed and then classified into a category of either \"true\", \"mostly true\", \"half true\", \"mostly false\", \"false\", and \"pants on fire\". [7] The rating into one of these classification is done by intensive research using the information which was public the day the statement was made. [7]\n",
    "\n",
    "For the scope of this project, the website is scraped to retrieve the latest political statements including metadata which are then used to train the fake-news model. "

All these information are saved in a pandas DataFrame.\n",

    "[POLITIFACT.com](https://www.politifact.com/) classifies each reviewed statement into an issue like health-care, economy, immigration and more. For each issue, a list of all statements assigned to this issue can be found. Before scraping the statements itself, the all available issues are scraped and saved in a list. \n",
    "Now, for each issue a maximum of 150 statements shall be scraped from [POLITIFACT.com](https://www.politifact.com/). This procedure makes it easy to access the subpages for each issue where around 30 statements are published before the next pages has to be called up. The URL changes only in attributes \"page\" and \"category\" when iterating over issues and pages. \n",
